///   remains valid.

/// [`grow`]: AllocRef::grow
/// [`shrink`]: AllocRef::shrink
/// [`dealloc`]: AllocRef::dealloc
///
/// ### Memory fitting
///
/// Some of the methods require that a layout *fit* a memory block. What it means for a layout to
/// "fit" a memory block means (or equivalently, for a memory block to "fit" a layout) is that the
/// following conditions must hold:
///
/// * The block must be allocated with the same alignment as [`layout.align()`], and
///
/// * The provided [`layout.size()`] must fall in the range `min ..= max`, where:
///   - `min` is the size of the layout most recently used to allocate the block, and
///   - `max` is the latest actual size returned from [`alloc`], [`grow`], or [`shrink`].
///
/// [`layout.align()`]: Layout::align
/// [`layout.size()`]: Layout::size
///
/// # Safety
///
/// * Memory blocks returned from an allocator must point to valid memory and retain their validity
///   until the instance and all of its clones are dropped,
///
/// * cloning or moving the allocator must not invalidate memory blocks returned from this
///   allocator. A cloned allocator must behave like the same allocator, and
///
/// * any pointer to a memory block which is [*currently allocated*] may be passed to any other
