//! Implementation of various bits and pieces of the `panic!` macro and
//! associated runtime pieces.
//!
//! Specifically, this module contains the implementation of:
//!
//! * Panic hooks
//! * Executing a panic up to doing the actual implementation
//! * Shims around "try"

#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]

// Note: The panicking functions have been stripped and rewritten
//       in order to save space in BPF programs.  Panic messages
//       are not supported, just file, line, column.
